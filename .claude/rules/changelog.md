# Memory Changelog

## 2026-08-20 — Fix: UI plugins dead after login
- Root cause: the takeover bridged `/api` straight to `toFetchHandler` and
  never re-provided the `connection` service, so the Typert Remote gateway
  (dsh-api-gateway) never registered its shared `/api` interceptor — every
  installed UI plugin's host RPC (`POST /api/<namespace>/<method>`) failed
  after login, admin included; non-admins additionally lost all
  `host/remote-event` pushes.
- Fix: `connection.ts` instantiates `HostConnectionService` (re-provides
  `connection`) and routes two-segment endpoints through
  `createSharedFetchHandler`; `api-filter.ts` `frameVisible` forwards global
  remote-event signals to ordinary users (cordis/* stays admin-only).
- Tests: typert interceptor dispatch, cookie-gated typert, unclaimed-shape
  404, connection-service presence; frameVisible expectations updated.

## 2026-08-18 — Multi-user gateway (feat/multiuser-isolation)
- Multi-user auth: UserStore (scrypt, `${password}_USERS` credential ref),
  admin bootstrap on first visit, `/admin` page + `/api/auth/admin/*` routes,
  `/api/auth/me`; legacy single password no longer authenticates.
- Identity-aware `/api` carrier takeover: `connection.ts` child plugin
  (prefix route + WS upgrades), `api-filter.ts` per-user proxy with
  allow-list + ownership filtering, `ownership.ts` sessionId→username
  sidecar; `cordis.patch.yml` disables the shipped `web-runtime` and
  `connection` rows; browser half shipped as `dist/client.js`
  (`connection.client.ts`, `scripts/build-client.mjs`).
- Memory files rewritten to match (architecture/modules/api/gotchas).
